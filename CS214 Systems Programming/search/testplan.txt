For my testing I used a few different cases. The first one I used the file test.txt and wrote the results to results.txt:
test.txt had:
H@E@llo&^
W%O#RL!D

and results.txt held the results:
<list> d
test1.txt 1
</list>
<list> e
test1.txt 1
</list>
<list> h
test1.txt 1
</list>
<list> llo
test1.txt 1
</list>
<list> o
test1.txt 1
</list>
<list> rl
test1.txt 1
</list>
<list> w
test1.txt 1
</list>

and valgrind showed no memory leaks or errors

For the second one I had a directory test which held test1.txt and a subdirectory testDir2 which held test2.txt
test1.txt had:
hello world this program@works
and test2.txt had:
this is a sub directory

the results.txt file was:
<list> a
test/testDir2/test2.txt 1
</list>
<list> directory
test/testDir2/test2.txt 1
</list>
<list> hello
test/test1.txt 1
</list>
<list> is
test/testDir2/test2.txt 1
</list>
<list> program
test/test1.txt 1
</list>
<list> sub
test/testDir2/test2.txt 1
</list>
<list> this
test/testDir2/test2.txt 1 test/test1.txt 1
</list>
<list> works
test/test1.txt 1
</list>
<list> world
test/test1.txt 1
</list>
which was correct correct again and valgrind also showed no errors or memory leaks. I also tested with empty files and files that dont exist and this does not cause any errors
